      <h1>OBS Studio and obs-websocket Join Forces</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Right around 8 months ago, Palakis and I were approached by the members here at the OBS Project with an idea: Make WebSocket functionality a core feature of OBS Studio. On July 3rd, I was pleased to announce the standalone release of obs-websocket version 5. This version is a complete rewrite of the popular plugin obs-websocket. With over a year of development finally behind us, this version brings a new protocol, many great features, and greatly improved reliability.<br>You can see the notable changes <a href="#">here.</a></p>

      <h1>What happened with 27.2: The tale of a<br> legendary hotfix</h1><br>
      <p>That was a crazy week. Let’s talk about what happened with 27.2 and what we had to do this past week.<br><br>
       With the Windows version of 27.2, we updated all of our dependencies. A dependency is a library made from external source code; something which is not OBS source code, but that OBS depends upon for major functionality and features. Sometimes this can be a feature such as software H.264 encoding, which relies on the x264 encoder library, or a feature such as the browser source, which relies on a much bigger dependency: Chromium (the browser engine that powers Google Chrome). More specifically, the browser source utilizes the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) to render a webpage as a source, or to render a webpage as a panel inside of OBS.</p>

      <h1>Announcing the OBS Project Bounty Program</h1><br>
      <p>When we first announced that the OBS Project would begin accepting sponsorships over two years<br> ago, our primary goal was to promote the sustainability of OBS development for its contributors.<br> Through your generosity, we’ve grown to be able to support <a href="#">two full-time developers</a>, as well as<br> give back to several contributors from the community in appreciation of their work. And for that, we are <br>extremely grateful!<br><br>
      However, for some time now, we’ve wanted to make our sponsorship funds go even farther. That’s why, today, we’re announcing the OBS Project Bounty Program. This new program allows us to share our highest priorities with the developer community and provide compensation for the developers who offer their time and expertise to meet those needs.</p>

      <h1>OBS Studio 27 Released, Featuring Undo/Redo,<br> Browser Docks on macOS, Linux, and more</h1><br>
      <p>After an extensive testing period, we’re happy to announce that OBS Studio 27 is now available for <br>everyone! If you already have OBS installed, the next time you launch it you’ll receive an update <br>alert. If you’re downloading OBS for the first time, or would like to use a portable version, you can<br><a href="#" >download it from our website</a>. If you dismiss the update notification, it can be triggered manually from the Help menu on both Windows and macOS.<br><br>
      Thanks to all who downloaded test builds, reported bugs, and verified that bugs were fixed during the testing period via the #beta-testing channel on<a href="#" > our Discord</a>. Every report means less of a reason to make a hotfix in the coming days, and ultimately results in a better experience for everyone.</p>
